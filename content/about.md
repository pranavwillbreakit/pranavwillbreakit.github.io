When I was a little pup I used to break everything. My da told me I will die of
hunger when I grow up if I keep breaking things. Naturally, I made it my
profession to prove him wrong, like everybody else.

You can hire me for freelance work. I mostly break things by hand (aka manual
testing). I am also learning automation these days, so that I can make things to
break things for me. I have a keen eye for security to keep 'em hackers at bay.
